# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to use machine learning in order to create a report that includes cryptocurrencies that are trading on the market currently, and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment.

## Results
Using Principal Component Analysis the large dataset had its variables trimmed to 3 Principal Components. This resulted in a dataframe of 532 cryptocurrencies. These were placed into 3 principal components and plotted in order to determine their current investment value. As seen in the 3D scatter below, class 3 holds the most value invesments while class 2 are the ones that should be avoided.</br>

This 2D scatter plot shows that most cryptocurrencies are in their infant stages with little mined coins but also a smaller coin supply leading to possible future price bumps as coins are mined.</br>
